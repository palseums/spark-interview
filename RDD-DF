1) RDD and DF are same in immutability, in memory computing, resilient, distributed computing
2) DF differs from RDD in maintaining the structure of the underlying data in the form of schema. Thus DF is equivalent to table in database
3) when data is structured infomation about the data can be collected and used to derive the best execution plan through RBO, CBO 
4) catalyst optimizer is available only to Data Frame
